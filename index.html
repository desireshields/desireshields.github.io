                 <h3>Personal Statement : By Desire Shields</h3>

                <p>Personal Statement

“I’ve learned that people will forget what you said , people will forget what you did , but people will never forget how you made them feel .” 

-Maya Angelou


I’ve learned that in order to be happy you have to learn yourself and get a deeper understanding with your inner person . Throughout high school as I’ve grown I realized what’s important and what I need to do in order to succeed , making a mark on the world . I sit and think  :what makes me different from everybody else ? How can I show the world that in a room filled of black boxes , i’m the red box ? I’ve figured it out as I have grown over the years . Take  third grade for instance , academically , I wasn’t my best , even then I searched for my purpose on what I will do when school is all over . “ If I can’t do a simple math problem what am I good at ? ” I stopped thinking about it for a while . “ I’m young , I’ll figure it out” , I was more interested in getting to know the new girl and helping her get around at the time .  Freshman year I started improving academically , but it still didn’t feel right . So right there I realized education , and mathematics isn’t something I enjoy . “ What do I enjoy doing ? ” I thought of the typical jobs such as Doctor . No , Lawyer ? Thats way too much talking . Teacher ? No , that would be a start but I don’t actually think that’s for me . Nothing interests me . “ I’ll figure it out ”. Then I went ahead to console my friend about a problem she was having . Now , as a high school senior , I don’t have time for the “I’ll think about it laters” and the “I’m young I’ll figure it outs” , college is approaching and time waits for nobody , so it’s crunch time . One day I went to my counselor to get a lot of concerns off my chest that I had at the time and one of which was what I wanted to do with my life , so I asked what made him decide what he will do with his life , and his answer was answered with another question . “How can I help a group of people feel good about themselves ?”
 He talked to me about how he was as a child and and who he is as a person , and we compared lives and we were similar in various ways . I went home that day and thought about my options .Then I started questioning myself , what would make Desire happy ? What would my mark on the world be ? I then thought about how I don’t want to be in someone’s cubical for the rest of my life , I don’t feel like I would be making a difference . People forget names , events , faces , nothing too spectacular , but how you make a person truly feel inside will be stuck with a person forever . Your first love , your mother and her caring nature , your teacher and his motivational influences , the guest speaker that shared her inspiring story and made you cry , my counselor and how he made me feel safe and like I can go talk to him whenever I get the chance . If I can change people’s life like my counselor did, that’s making your mark on not just one person but hundreds and thousands of other people you could be helping as a career . Social work . I finally found my calling , what’s my mark . Surgants go home many days saying “wow , I saved a whole life today” , teachers go to bed many nights thinking “Wow I helped that young girl truly understand that math equation” . I want to go home with the satisfaction of “Wow , I took a young girl out of a situation that she would have regret.” I know there will be many nights that I come home and think I can’t save everybody and I understand things get hard , but with the drive , courage , my persistent attitude ,  and determination I have for not giving up , I know I’m resilient enough for anything that the job will throw at me . What mark will you make on the world ? I finally know the answer . .</p>
